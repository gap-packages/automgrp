\Section{Some predefined groups}

Several groups are predefined as a fields in the global variable 
`AG_Groups'. Here is how to access, for example, Grigorchuk group

\beginexample 
gap> G:=AG_Groups.GrigorchukGroup;
< a, b, c, d >
\endexample

To perform operations with elements of `G' one can use `AssignGeneratorVariables' function.

\beginexample 
gap> AssignGeneratorVariables(G);
#I  Global variable `a' is already defined and will be overwritten
#I  Global variable `b' is already defined and will be overwritten
#I  Global variable `c' is already defined and will be overwritten
#I  Global variable `d' is already defined and will be overwritten
#I  Assigned the global variables [ a, b, c, d ]
gap> Decompose(a*b);
(c, a)(1,2)
\endexample

Below is the list of all predefined groups with short description and references.


\>GrigorchukGroup 

is the first Grigorchuk group, an infinite 2-group of intermediate growth constructed 
in~\cite{grigorch:burnside} (see also~\cite{grigorch:solved}). It is 
defined as a group generated by automaton 
$$a=(1,1)(1,2),\quad b=(a,c),\quad c=(a,d),\quad d=(1,b)\.$$

\>Basilica

is the Basilica group. It was first studied in \cite{grigorch-z:basilica} and 
\cite{grigorch-z:basilica-sp}. Later it became the first example of amenable, but not subexponentially 
amenable group (see \cite{bartholdi-v:amenab}) and the iterated monodromy group of a map $f(z)=z^2-1$. 
It is generated by automaton 
$$u=(v,1)(1,2),\quad v=(u,1)\.$$

\>Lamplighter

is the Lamplighter group. This group was a key to the counterexample (see~\cite{grigorch-lsz:atiyah})
to the strong Atiyah conjecture. It is generated by automaton 
$$a=(a,b)(1,2),\quad b=(a,b)\.$$

\>AddingMachine

is a free abelian group of rank 1 (see~\cite{gns00:automata}) generated by automaton
$$a=(1,a)(1,2)\.$$  

\>InfiniteDihedral 

is the infinite dihedral group (see~\cite{gns00:automata}) generated by automaton
$$a=(a,a)(1,2),\quad b=(b,a)\.$$
  
\>AleshinGroup 

is the free group of rank 3 generated by Aleshin automaton (see~\cite{aleshin:free})
$$a=(b,c)(1,2),\quad b=(c,b)(1,2),\quad c=(a,a)\.$$
It was proved just recently by M.Vorobets and Ya.Vorobets (see~\cite{vorobets:aleshin})
that the group is indeed free of rank 3.

\>Bellaterra 

is the free product of 3 cyclic groups of oreder 2 (see~\cite{bondarenko-gkmnss:clas32II})
$$a=(c,c)(1,2),\quad b=(a,b),\quad c=(b,a)\.$$

\>SushchanskyGroup 

is the self-similar closure of the faithful level-transitive action of Sushchansky group on the
ternary tree. The original groups constructed in~\cite{sushch:burnside} are infinite $p$-groups 
of intermediate growth acting on $p$-ary tree. In~\cite{bondarenko-s:sushch} the action of these 
groups on the tree was simplified, so that, in particular, the self-similar closure of one of the 3-groups 
is generated by automaton
$$A=(1,1,1)(1,2,3),\quad A^2=(1,1,1)(1,3,2),\quad B=(r_1,q_1,A),$$
$$r_1=(r_2,A,1),\quad r_2=(r_3,1,1),\quad r_3=(r_4,1,1),$$
$$r_4=(r_5,A,1),\quad r_5=(r_6,A^2,1),\quad r_6=(r_7,A,1),$$
$$r_7=(r_8,A,1),\quad r_8=(r_9,A,1),\quad r_9=(r_1,A^2,1),$$
$$q_1=(q_2,1,1),\quad q_2=(q_3,A,1),\quad q_3=(q_1,A,1)\.$$
The group $\langle A,B\rangle$ is isomorphic to the original Sushchansky 3-group.
  
\>Hanoi3 
\>Hanoi4 

Groups related to the Hanoi towers game on 3 and 4 pegs correspondingly 
(see~\cite{grigorchuk-s:hanoi-crm} and \cite{grigorchuk-s:hanoi}).
For 3 pegs `Hanoi3' is generated by automaton
$$a_{23}=(a_{23},1,1)(2,3),\quad a_{13}=(1,a_{13},1)(1,3),\quad a_{12}=(1,1,a_{12})(1,2),$$
while the automaton generating `Hanoi4' is
$$a_{12}=(1,1,a_{12},a_{12})(1,2),\quad a_{13}=(1,a_{13},1,a_{13})(1,3),\quad a_{14}=(1,a_{14},a_{14},1)(1,4),$$
$$a_{23}=(a_{23},1,1,a_{23})(2,3),\quad a_{24}=(a_{24},1,a_{24},1)(2,4),\quad a_{34}=(a_{34},a_{34},1,1)(3,4)\.$$


\>GuptaSidki3Group 

is a Gupta-Sidki infinite 3-group constructed in~\cite{gupta-s:burnside} and generated by automaton
$$a=(1,1,1)(1,2,3),\quad b=(a,a^{-1},b)\.$$

\>GuptaFabrikowskiGroup 

is a Gupta-Fabrykowski group of intermediate growth constructed in~\cite{fabrykowski-g:subexpon} and 
generated by automaton
$$a=(1,1,1)(1,2,3),\quad b=(a,1,b)\.$$

\>BartholdiGrigorchukGroup 

is a Bartholdi-Grigorchuk group studied in~\cite{bartholdi-g:parabolic} and generated by automaton
$$a=(1,1,1)(1,2,3),\quad b=(a,a,b)\.$$

\>ErschlerGrigorchukGroup 

is a group of subexponential growth studied by Erschler in~\cite{erschler:boundary}. 
It grows faster than $\exp(n^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha\<1$. It belongs to the class of groups
constructed by Grigorchuk in~\cite{grigorch:degrees} and corresponds to the sequence $01010101\ldots$. 
It is generated by automaton
$$a=(1,1)(1,2),\quad b=(a,b),\quad c=(a,d),\quad d=(1,c)\.$$

\>BartholdiNonunifExponGroup 

is a group of nonuniformly exponential growth constructed by Bartholdi in~\cite{bartholdi:nonuniform}. Similar 
examples were constructed earlier in \cite{wilson:nonuniform} by Wilson. It is generated by automaton
$$x=(1,1,1,1,1,1,1)(1,5)(3,7),\quad y=(1,1,1,1,1,1,1)(2,3)(6,7),\quad z=(1,1,1,1,1,1,1)(4,6)(5,7),$$
$$x_1=(x_1,x,1,1,1,1,1),\quad y_1=(y_1,y,1,1,1,1,1),\quad z_1=(z_1,z,1,1,1,1,1)\.$$

\>IMG_z2plusI

Iterated monodromy group of the map $f(z)=z^2+i$. It has intermediate growth (see~\cite{bux-p:iter-monodromy}) 
and was studied in \cite{grigorch-ss:img}.
$$a=(1,1)(1,2),\quad b=(a,c), c=(b,1)\.$$


\>Airplane
\>Rabbit

These are iterated monodromy groups of certain quadratic polynomials studied in~\cite{bartholdi-n:rabbit}. 
It was proved there that they are not isomorphic. The automata generating them are the following
$$a=(b,1)(1,2),\quad b=(c,1),\quad c=(a,1);$$
$$a=(b,1)(1,2),\quad b=(1,c),\quad c=(a,1)\.$$

\>TwoStateSemigroupOfIntermediateGrowth

is the smallest semigroup of intermediate growth generated by automaton
$$f_0=(f_0,f_0)(1,2),\quad f_1=(f_1,f_0)[2,2].$$
It was studied in~\cite{bartholdi-rs:intermed}.
