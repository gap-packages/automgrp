Changes from 1.0 to 1.1

- The bug with contracting level was fixed (in some rare cases IsOne produced error for contracting groups)
- Order was improved (especially for infinite order and for groups generated by wreath recursion)
- Spherical transitivity for the elements of groups given by wreath recursion acting on binary tree
  was implemented
- Rewriting systems work for self-similar groups now
- IsOfSubexponentialGrowth was added
- TransformationSemigroupOnLevel was added
- Printing of tree homomorphisms was corrected
- FindGroupRelations returns less superfluous relations now
- Operations for finding transitive elements in a self-similar groups acting on a binary tree were
  implemented (see SphericallyTransitiveElement and ContainsSphericallyTransitiveElement)
- Work with finite self-similar groups was improved
- Some bugs in documentation were fixed
