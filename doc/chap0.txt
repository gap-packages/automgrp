  [1m[4m[31mColophon[0m
  The  project  was originally started in 2000 mostly for personal use. It was
  gradually  expadnig  during consequent years, including both addition of new
  algorithms  and simplification of user interface. It was used in the process
  of  classification  of  groups generated by $3$-state automata over 2-letter
  alphabet.
