Changes from 1.3.2 to 1.3.3

- Change how Projection is implemented, to avoid causing warnings in
  *other* packages that provide Projection methods if those packages get
  loaded after automgrp (for the experts: we no longer turn Projection
  into a "KeyDependentOperation")
- A bunch of janitorial changes

Changes from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2

- Fix some method ranks for compatibility with GAP 4.11
- Fix ShallowCopy for AG_SemigroupIterator
- A bunch of janitorial changes

Changes from 1.3 to 1.3.1

- Operation FindGroupRelations now accepts IsGroup as one of the possible arguments
- The issue with the increase of the rank of IsFinite filter caused by IsAmenable TrueMethod was fixed
- InstallMethodWithRandomSource was incorporated for Random methods (thanks to Max Horn)
- A couple of minor syntax updates

Changes from 1.2.4 to 1.3

- Status was changed from "deposited" to "accepted"
- The very much appreciated comments and suggestions of the anonymous referee were implemented. Some are listed below
- Converters to and from `FR' package by Laurent Bartholdi were implemented (see AutomGrp2FR and FR2AutomGrp)
- Minimization of automata was greatly optimized based on (also very much appreciated) the implementation of this function by Andrey Russev
- Print methods were updated for several basic types
- IsSphericallyTransitive has been updated
- A bug in TransformationSemigroupOnLevel was fixed
- TransformationOnFirstLevel now always returns transformations (it was returning permutations when possible before)
- A bug in MarkovOperator for semigroups was fixed
- AG_IsInvertibleTransformation was removed as redundant
- Error messages were updated
- Documentation was updated
- Several new tests were added

Changes from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4

- The date format in PackageInfo.g was changed to comply with GAP standards for packages

Changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3

- The EOL issue was fixed in the test file /tst/testall.tst

Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2

- The order of generators in AG_UseRewritingSystem was updated according to a new GAP release
- References to bibliography were updated
- Documentation was cleaned

Changes from 1.2 to 1.2.1

- Broken URLs were fixed
- AllSections was extended to IsAutom argument
- Section was extended to work with (semi)groups, not only with their elements


Changes from 1.1.4.2 to 1.2

- Added IsAcyclic for Mealy automata
- Added IsReversible, IsMDTrivial, MDReduction
- Added MihailovaSystem
- MarkovOperator is implemented for semigroups and now can accept the (possibly symbolic) weights
- Added a possibility to define automata over 1-letter alphabet (needed for MD-reduction)
- Suppressed the output of dots while performing the tests
- Banner Added

Changes from 1.1.4.1 to 1.1.4.2

- Replaced $ character in identifiers with underscores


Changes from 1.1.4 to 1.1.4.1

- Methods with more than six arguments were really removed this time


Changes from 1.1.3 to 1.1.4

- Methods with more than six arguments were removed
- Documentation of the package now is loaded automatically
- Minor corrections in documentation
- File with predefined groups is actually included in the release


Changes from 1.1.2 to 1.1.3

- The bug sometimes yielding a wrong answer to the question of inclusion of an element into a group
  acting on the tree of degree not less than 3 was fixed
- The issue of changing the GAP output after loading the package related to Indeterminate(GF(2))
  was overcome


Changes from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2

- IsAutomatonRep was renamed to IsMealyAutomatonRep,  and
  DiagonalAction was renamed to DiagonalPower to avoid conflicts
  with other packages

Changes from 1.1 to 1.1.1

- The bug with undeclared local variable in one of the tests was fixed

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1

- The bug with contracting level was fixed (in some rare cases IsOne produced error for contracting groups)
- Order was improved (especially for infinite order and for groups generated by wreath recursion)
- Spherical transitivity for the elements of groups given by wreath recursion acting on binary tree
  was implemented
- Rewriting systems work for self-similar groups now
- IsOfSubexponentialGrowth was added
- TransformationSemigroupOnLevel was added
