Changes from 1.1.4.1 to 1.1.4.2

Changes from 1.1.3 to 1.1.4

- Methods with more than six arguments were removed
- Documentation of the package now is loaded automatically
- Minor corrections in documentation

Changes from 1.1.2 to 1.1.3

- The bug sometimes yielding a wrong answer to the question of inclusion of an element into a group
  acting on the tree of degree not less than 3 was fixed

  was overcome


Changes from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2

- IsAutomatonRep was renamed to IsMealyAutomatonRep,  and
  DiagonalAction was renamed to DiagonalPower to avoid conflicts
  with other packages

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1

- The bug with contracting level was fixed (in some rare cases IsOne produced error for contracting groups)
- Order was improved (especially for infinite order and for groups generated by wreath recursion)
- Spherical transitivity for the elements of groups given by wreath recursion acting on binary tree
  was implemented
