  <Colophon>The project was originally started in 2000 mostly for personal use. It was gradually
    expadnig during consequent years, including both addition of new algorithms and simplification of
    user interface. It was used in the process of classification of groups generated by $3$-state
    automata over 2-letter alphabet
