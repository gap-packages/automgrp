\>MinimizeAutomTrack( <G> ) F

Returns an automaton obtained from automaton <G> by minimization.


\>AddInverses( <G> ) F

Returns an automaton obtained from automaton <G> by adding inverse elements and
the identity element, and minimizing the result.


\>AddInversesTrack( <G> ) F

Finds an automaton `G_new' obtained from automaton <G> by adding inverse elements and
the identity element, and minimizing the result. Returns the list
`[G_new,track_s,track_l]', where
`track_s' is how new states are expressed in terms of the old ones, and
`track_l' is how old states are expressed in terms of the new ones.

\>IsCorrectAutomatonList( <list>, <invertible> ) F

Checks whether the list is correct list to define automaton, i.e.:
$[[a_11,...,a_1n,p_1],[a_21,...,a_2n,p_2],...,[a_m1...a_mn,p_m]]$,
where $n >= 2$, $m >= 1$, $a_ij$ are IsInt in $[1..m]$; and all p_i are
in SymmetricalGroup(n) (semigroup of transformations of the set $\{1..n\}$)
if invertible=true (false).


\>ConnectedStatesInList( <state>, <list> ) F

Returns list of states which can be reached from given state.


\>IsTrivialStateInList( <state>, <list> ) F

Checks whether given state is trivial.


\>AreEquivalentStatesInList( <state1>, <state2>, <list> ) F

Checks whether two given states are equivalent.


\>AreEquivalentStatesInLists( <state1>, <state2>, <list1>, <list2> ) F

Checks whether two given states in different lists are equivalent.


\>ReducedAutomatonInList( <list> ) F

Returns [new_list, list_of_states] where new_list is a new list which
represents reduced form of given automaton, i-th elmt of list_of_states
is the number of i-th state of new automaton in the old one.

First state of returned list is always first state of given one.
It does not remove trivial state, so it's not really ``reduced automaton'',
it just removes equivalent states.
TODO: write such function which removes trivial state


\>MinimalSubAutomatonInlist( <states>, <list> ) F

Returns list representation of automaton given by <list> which is minimal
subatomaton of automaton containing states <states>.


\>PermuteStatesInList( <list>, <perm> ) F

Does not check correctness of arguments.


\>WordStateInList( <w>, <s>, <list>, <reduce>, <trivstate> ) F

It's ProjectWord from selfs.g
Does not check correctness of arguments.


\>WordStateAndPermInList( <w>, <s>, <list> ) F

Does not check correctness of arguments.


\>ImageOfVertexInList( <list>, <init>, <vertex> ) F


\>DiagonalActionInList( <list>, <n> ) F


\>MultAlphabetInList( <list>, <n> ) F


\>HasDualInList( <list> ) F
\>HasDualOfInverseInList( <list> ) F
\>DualAutomatonList( <list> ) F
