Changes from 1.0 to 1.1

- The bug with contracting level was fixed (in some rear cases IsOne did not work for contracting groups)
- Order was improved (especially for infinite order and for groups generated by wreath recursion)
- Spherical transitivity for the elements of groups geven by wreath recursion acting on binary tree
  was implemented
- TransformationSemigroupOnLevel was added
- Printing of tree homomorphisms was corrected
- FindGroupRelations returns less superfluous relations now
- Operations for finding transitive elements in a self-similar groups acting on a binary tree were 
  implemented (see SphericallyTransitiveElement and ContainsSphericallyTransitiveElement)
- Some bugs in documentation were fixed
